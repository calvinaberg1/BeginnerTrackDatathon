# LoanDefaultRiceDatathon
## Overview
This project was made for the 2022 [Rice University Datathon](https://datathon.rice.edu), a 24 hour data science challenge in teams of up to 4. With my team, we worked on a dataset of loan defaults and experimented with EDA, creating visuals, predicting loan default, and predicting interest rate.

In this project, we thoroughly worked through the data sceince pipeline, working through the following steps: 
- Cleaning our data
- EDA
- Creating visualizations
- Feature engineering
- Modeling
- Model Evalutation

I'm incredibly proud of this project and the project we were able to achieve with only 24 hours to work on a complex problem.

### Cleaning
In the cleaning section, we had to deal with missing values in 13 columns. To handle this, we worked to understand the columns with missing values, and appropriately filled with the necessary fields. In many cases, the missing values were supplements for 0, or for some field (like 'Accepted' for denial_reason). \n
